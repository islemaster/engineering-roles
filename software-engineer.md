* Deploy and support features in production, with an operationally-focused mindset;
* Communicate ideas clearly, respond professionally to feedback, and commit to team direction;
* Actively contribute to our culture of working hard and having fun, while respecting others and delivering on our mission of enabling “all students in all schools to learn computer science”.

### *What growth could look like for you*:
At Code.org we strive to create a growth-oriented culture. We ask our team members to provide candid, constructive, and example-focused feedback anytime throughout the year directly to their teammates; a couple of times during the year we ask each person on the team to provide a bit more formal written feedback that can be used between a manager and engineer to offer specific guidance toward individual growth plans. Everyone on the team regardless of job function or time in role gets to participate. Currently, we do not do formal performance reviews or ratings, have job levels, or perform stack ranking as we believe these can contribute to a comparative, competitive, or tier-focused culture; we do place value in each individuals unique contribution which help us achieve our mission. Our growth "yardstick”, shown below, can be used as a template for self-measuring technical and leadership expansion and to establish individual growth goals as one progresses through their time in an engineering role.

### *Our growth yardstick*:
| **Focus Area** | **1 to 3 years** | **4 to 8 years** | **8 years and beyond** |
| :------- | :-------: | :-------: | :-------: |
| **Coding Fluency** | | | |
| **Coding Quality** | | | |
| **Design** | | | |
| **Impact** | Collaborative team member, shares ideas and feedback. Impact is generally at a component-level. | Collaborative team member, shares ideas and feedback, including advising others. Impact is generally at a product-level within a team. | Collaborative team member, shares ideas and feedback, including advising leadership team. Impact is generally cross-product and cross-team. |
| **Influence** | Provides constructive code review feedback within the team. | Provides constructive code review feedback within team focused on best practices, insistence on code quality, code readability, and long-term sustainability. | Is generally familiar with enough of the product, system architectures, and codebase that can provide constructive code review feedback across the entire team focused on best practices, insistence on code quality, code readability, and long-term sustainability. |
| **Problem Solving** | Solves straightforward technical problems, with assistance from other engineers at times. Ideas or solutions may need refinement. | Solves complex technical problems from design to feature delivery, independently. Has become a “go-to” person for others on the team when problems arise. | Solves significantly complex technical problems that span multiple systems or products, with independence. Is able to simply explain solutions when teaching others. |
