Software Engineer (**DRAFT**)
-----------------
The purpose of this document is to describe the general responsibilities and expectations for a software engineer at Code.org and to provide directional guidance for what growth looks like in this role.

### *As a software engineer you have*:
* Competency in at least one core programming language;
* Strong computer science fundamentals;
* Experienced working as part of a team;
* Motivated and curious learner;
* Passion for the Code.org mission.

### *As a software engineer you will*:
* Write functional, well-tested, high-quality code to deliver end to end features;
* Create design documents that consider scalability, availability, and performance;
* Share work estimates with reasonable accuracy, working in an Agile development environment;
* Ask clarifying questions that remove ambiguity around product or projects;
* Work independently when required, while also being a collaborative builder;
* Provide candid and constructive code review feedback to other engineers on the team;
* Become an expert in at least one area of our product or technology stack;
* Deploy and support features in production, with an operationally-focused mindset;
* Communicate ideas clearly, respond professionally to feedback, and commit to team direction;
* Actively contribute to our culture of working hard and having fun, while respecting others and delivering on our mission of enabling “all students in all schools to learn computer science”.

### *What growth could look like for you*:
At Code.org we strive to create a growth-oriented culture. We ask our team members to provide candid, constructive, and example-focused feedback anytime throughout the year directly to their teammates; a couple of times during the year we ask each person on the team to provide a bit more formal written feedback that can be used between a manager and engineer to offer specific guidance toward individual growth plans. Everyone on the team regardless of job function or time in role gets to participate. Currently, we do not do formal performance reviews or ratings, have job levels, or perform stack ranking as we believe these can contribute to a comparative, competitive, or tier-focused culture; we do place value in each individuals unique contribution which help us achieve our mission. Our growth "yardstick”, shown below, can be used as a template for self-measuring technical and leadership expansion and to establish individual growth goals as one progresses through their time in an engineering role.

### *Our growth yardstick*:
| **Focus Area** | **1 to 3 years** | **4 to 8 years** | **8 years and beyond** |
| :------- | :-------: | :-------: | :-------: |
| **Coding Fluency** | With solid CS fundamentals, is able to use code to build a functional product within a reasonable amount of time. Can actively take on small and medium-sized projects that add to existing features and components. Is proficient with at least one programming language. | With strong CS fundamentals, is able to use code to build functional products from scratch in a reasonable amount of time. Effective with both frontend and backend programming languages. Provides exemplary use of algorithms, data structures, and more advanced concepts. | Expert CS fundamentals across multiple programming languages and technologies. Actively mentors and teaches others across the both in pair programming models and through code review feedback. Often experiments with ways to improve the performance of algorithms, reduce the lines of code in the codebase, or increase the efficiency and sustainability of the codebase. |
| **Coding Quality** | Code correctly solves the problem in a minimal way, is written in a way that is reasonably understood, and follows norms of existing codebase. Feedback provided throughout the review process is quickly accepted and adopted. | Code solves the problem with in an effective and efficient manner, is well tested, free of errors, and is easy to follow for those new to the codebase. Code reviews generally have minimal feedback. Is active in helping others improve and raise the bar of the team’s code. | Code written is exemplary due to efficiency, simplicity, and use of best practices. Code is well-tested and documented. Actively participates in helping others to understand, meet, and eventually raise the bar in coding quality across the entire org. |
| **Communication** | Able to communicate ideas clearly. Asks questions to remove ambiguity. If misunderstandings arise, able to patiently clarify message. | Shares ideas fluently in both written and verbal form. Comfortable speaking within team and can clearly explain and strongly advocate for ideas. | As a perceptive communicator, able to use all forms and styles of communication to disambiguate complex messages and ideas to a broad audience. A great listener, they are able to help others communicate and clarify their ideas in group settings. Able to drive agreement in most discussions even when different views are presented. |
| **Design** |  |  | Experienced in full-stack systems and is able to offer perceptive and critical feedback in how to build, scale, and operate highly-available systems. Provides architectural and design guidance when solutions are not well-defined. |
| **Impact** | Collaborative team member, shares ideas and feedback. Impact is generally at a component-level. | Collaborative team member, shares ideas and feedback, including advising others. Impact is generally at a product-level within a team. | Collaborative team member, shares ideas and feedback, including advising leadership team. Impact is generally cross-product and cross-team. |
| **Influence** | Provides constructive code review feedback within the team. | Provides constructive code review feedback within team focused on best practices, insistence on code quality, code readability, and long-term sustainability. | Is generally familiar with enough of the product, system architectures, and codebase that can provide constructive code review feedback across the entire team focused on best practices, insistence on code quality, code readability, and long-term sustainability. |
| **Problem Solving** | Solves straightforward technical problems, with assistance from other engineers at times. Ideas or solutions may need refinement. | Solves complex technical problems from design to feature delivery, independently. Has become a “go-to” person for others on the team when problems arise. | Solves significantly complex technical problems that span multiple systems or products, with independence. Is able to simply explain solutions when teaching others. |
