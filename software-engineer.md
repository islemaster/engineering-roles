* Share work estimates with reasonable accuracy, working in an Agile development environment;
* Ask clarifying questions that remove ambiguity around product or projects;
* Work independently when required, while also being a collaborative builder;
* Provide candid and constructive code review feedback to other engineers on the team;

### Contribution and growth matrix offered for general growth guidance:
At Code.org we strive to create a growth-oriented culture. We ask our teams to provide candid, constructive, and example-focused feedback anytime throughout the year directly to their teammates; a couple of times each year we ask each person on the team to provide a bit more formal written feedback that can be used between a manager and engineer to help offer specific feedback and guidance toward individual growth plans. Everyone on the team regardless of job function or time in role gets to participate. We do not currently do formal performance reviews, have job levels, or do stack ranking as we believe these can contribute to a comparative, competitive, or tier-focused culture; rather we value individually unique contributions that help us achieve our mission. We do offer our “growth yardstick” (see below) as a template for self-measuring technical and leadership expansion and which can be used establishing individual growth goals.

| **Our Growth Yardstick** | **~ 1 to 3 years** | **~ 4 to 8 years** | **~ 8 years and beyond** |
| :------- | :-------: | :-------: | :-------: |
| **Technical** | Solves straightforward technical problems, with assistance from other engineers at times. Solutions may need refinement. | Solves complex technical problems from design to feature delivery, independently. Provides constructive code review feedback across the team. | Solves significantly complex technical problems, providing architectural and design guidance when solutions are not well-defined. |
| **Leadership** | Collaborative team member, shares ideas and feedback. Impact is generally at a component-level. | Collaborative team member, shares ideas and feedback, including advising others. Impact is generally at a product-level within a team. | Collaborative team member, shares ideas and feedback, including advising leadership team. Impact is generally cross-product and cross-team. |
